## About Me

I'm a first year Masters student in Computer Science at North Carolina State University. Prior to this, I was working as a Software Engineer at Micro Focus, Bangalore, India, where I actively contributed to the development and enhancement of ZENworks, an infrastructure management product.

I identify myself as a hard-working, confident and highly motivated individual who is a team player, problem solver and a quick-learner. My interest lies at the intersection of systems (parallel and distributed) and business intelligence. I like working on solutions that could scale to large amounts of data by leveraging many distributed architecture systems. I also take interest and have worked on many
optimization and performance improvement challenges, where the objective was achieved by designing efficient algorithms, query optimization and developing frameworks to effectively handle load. During my previous employment, I got an opportunity to solve a wide array of interesting problems, lead design discussions and learn software design practices. I was also given the role of a Scrum Master where I worked on enforcing scrum practices, tracking progress, facilitating effective backlog grooming,
planning, driving test-driven development, cross-team coordination, people management, resolving dependencies and ensuring seamless sprint execution.

In my journey so far, I have tried to explore various opportunities, took up different roles and responsibilities and built both my technical and soft skills
